# Pizza Time

Order Pizza from Titan's premier pizza joint.

## Description

Provide a name and email address to get access to the pizza order form. Select your size and toppings and complete your order to see your estimated delivery times.


### Tech used
Leveraged Bootstrap for styling and building forms, but also used inline internal and external css across the project.
Stored pizza data in an object to later construct a string with the appropriate selections for the user.
Used Javascript to display a new div containing a final button and information about their order. 
Used a table on the last page to organize delivery times to our service area. Sorry if the time seem a little long, we haven't quite figured out our worm drive yet.
Pineapple always belongs on pizza.
